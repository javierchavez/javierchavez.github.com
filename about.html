<div id="about_pic">
	Hi, my name is Javier Chavez, I'm a student here in Albuquerque and I think I
finally found a degree I'm sticking to.
	I started out with Computer Science, switched to Biology then Biochemistry now I'm
back to Computer Science. In the mist of all my indecisiveness, I enjoy triathlons and working with Emergency Medicine.

	I started working with computers around 7th grade. It wasn't long after when I learned HTML/CSS. At the time flash as well as JavaScript were popular, which is how I officially starting programming and self studying web development. Fast forward to now, I still love writing JavaScript but I've moved on to study Java to work with Android SDK.
